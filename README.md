Completely automated farming solution for "TribalWars" game (browser strategy).
Can be configured to run on different server-groups:

1. Language-specific data is controlled in 'bot.app.locale.py'.
2. Server-specific data (server speed, etc.) is controlled in 'settings.py'.

To run the bot:

1. Python3 is needed.
2. Install dependencies with 'pip install -r requirements.txt".
3. Adjust settings in 'settings.py' file.
4. Run 'python runner.py' command.

For now, bot was tested on .net "TribalWars" servers with Debian 7.3/Chromium,
but there are good chances ( :) ) that it will run smoothly on Debian OS family
(Ubuntu, etc.) and Windows (Vista, 7) with Chrome/Chromium browsers.
