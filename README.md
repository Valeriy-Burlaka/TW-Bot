## This project is now archived  

This project was a farming bot for browser MMO strategy game "Travian 1".
I created this project in 2013-2014 solely for educational purposes and you should never run it for real. Not only it can provide an unfair advantage in the game but it also would probably violate Travian UELA, which can cause a ban of a User account.
This project helped me to strengthen my Python programming skills and to learn a ton about how the Web is functioning overall.
